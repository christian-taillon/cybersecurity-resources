# General Infosec

### MITRE Attack Framework
Knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. Resource attempting to comprehensively cover all known methods of accomplishing adversarial goals.

Great resource to know how to use. Not something you need to or perhaps even can memorize. It is prudent to read through however and if you don't understand a topic, DuckDuck-Go it.

## Train Hard, Train Smart
The InfoSec profession does require a good deal of knowledge; but high performing security practitioners are those with an equally impressive set of skills through  which to execute that knowledge.

[VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) is a created repository of community contributed  VMs made vulnerable by design for various purposes training. Typically CTF style targets with the goal of finding hidden flags which prove the accomplishment of some gained level of access. Used for practicing adversarial work.

Nothing prohibits you from attempting to secure the VMs from the same attacks you used to gain access.
